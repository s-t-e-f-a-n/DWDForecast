dwdforecast
===========

From the original author <https://github.com/kilianknoll/DWDForecast>.

Extended by s-t-e-f-a-n to support the following features:

* Added support for Docker
* Added InfluxDB connection
* Added Trina Solar and Hoymiles support

Introduction
------------

This library provides a  Python interface to access DWD weatherforecast data to project solar power generation:
It will extract the following data from a MOSMIX file -see further down below for specifications

* Rad1h
* TTT
* PPPP
* FF

It uses pvlib to leverage the parameters above in conjunction with a configurable solar system and present hourly forecast the next 10 days.
Forecast data contains:

* ACSim: Simulated AC of solar system
* DCSim: Simulated DC of solar system
* CellTempSim: Temperature of solar cells [°C]
* Rad1Energy: Simplified calculation of solar system´s power generation

It has been tested with Python version 3.10.5, 3.9.2 (OLD: 3.6.2, 3.7.3)

Tested with
------------

* Raspberry & Windows

Installation
------------

Clone / Download repo and use dwdforecast.py

Configuration
-------------

To adapt to your needs - familiarize yourself with the content of data we are about to parse  (Keyword : Mosmix):
<https://www.dwd.de/DE/leistung…_blob=publicationFile&v=3>

List of available (virtual) weatherstations:
<https://www.dwd.de/DE/leistung…=nasPublication&nn=495490>

Please check the closest weatherstation to your location:
<https://wettwarn.de/mosmix/mosmix.html>

Once you found the closest station, note the number and change the python script in the inline comments to your needs

Next major section is the configuration is to change the solar system´s key characteristics such as location, azimuth, elevation, inverter, pannels etc.
Please see configuration.ini file for more description.

Running the script
------------------

python3 dwdforecast.py

Features
--------

* Provide Class that reads the weatherstation via a seperate thread and create a list of forementioned data
* Supports two modes of operation
  * Simple : will query the DWD internet site once and pull the data
  * Complex: will run in a continuous loop to gather data and download when updates are available

* Output (configurable):
  * Printoutput
  * CSV Output
  * Upload to mariaDB
